Numix Giba
==========

Tweaked Numix-Circle icons theme.

This icon theme extends the original Numix icon theme circle and add replaces a few status icons.
Original theme: https://numixproject.org/ ([Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) has to be installed for this theme to work).

If using Ubuntu, there is a repository for it:
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-circle
```

Some status and places icons were copied from:
* [Nitrux icons](https://github.com/NitruxSA/nitrux-icons)
* [Faba Icon Theme](http://mokaproject.com/faba-icon-theme/)

I haven't created or changed any artwork, just put them together.
